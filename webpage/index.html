                    For as long as I can remember, the aspiration to join the esteemed Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) has burned within me. It was more than a goal; it was a lifelong dream. Today, as I reflect upon my remarkable experience at IIT, I am thrilled to share the story of my journey and the invaluable lessons I have gained along the way through an interview with the Indian Express.

                    Recently In Elan & Î·Vision 2023, I volunteered in Cultie&Biggies Domain.It was a wonderful experience i ever had. I met with one of Hyderabad Artist named KASYAP, It was really fun.
                    Then on another day The Great Artist came to our campus GAJENDRA VERMA, He is known for his melodic voice and his ability to convey emotions through his songs. His music often reflects themes of love, heartbreak, and introspection, and luckily I met him after his concert.
